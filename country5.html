        <h2>GINI Coefficient</h2>
        <h3>What is Gini?</h3>
        <p>In economics, the Gini coefficient is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income inequality or the wealth inequality within a nation or a social group. The Gini coefficient was developed by the statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.</p>
        <h3>Interpreting the values</h3>
        <p>A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same (for example, where everyone has the same income). A Gini coefficient of one (or 100%) expresses maximal inequality among values (e.g., for a large number of people where only one person has all the income or consumption and all others have none, the Gini coefficient will be nearly one).</p>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>The Gini coefficient is a relative measure. It is possible for the Gini coefficient of a developing country to rise (due to increasing inequality of income) while the number of people in absolute poverty decreases.This is because the Gini coefficient measures relative, not absolute, wealth.</p>

        <h2>GDP (PPP)</h2>
        <h3>What is GDP?</h3>
        <p>Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period.</p>
        <h3>Difference between Nominal and PPP?</h3>
        <p>GDP comparisons using PPP are arguably more useful than those using nominal GDP when assessing a nation's domestic market because PPP takes into account the relative cost of local goods, services and inflation rates of the country, rather than using international market exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in per capita income.</p>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>Critics of the growth imperative often argue that GDP measures were never intended to measure progress, and leave out key other externalities, such as resource extraction, environmental impact and unpaid domestic work.</p>
