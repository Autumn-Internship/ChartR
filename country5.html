        <h2>GINI Coefficient</h2>
        <h3>What is Gini?</h3>
        <p>In economics, the Gini coefficient is a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income inequality or the wealth inequality within a nation or a social group. The Gini coefficient was developed by the statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.</p>
        <h3>Interpreting the values</h3>
        <p>A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same (for example, where everyone has the same income). A Gini coefficient of one (or 100%) expresses maximal inequality among values (e.g., for a large number of people where only one person has all the income or consumption and all others have none, the Gini coefficient will be nearly one).</p>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>The Gini coefficient is a relative measure. It is possible for the Gini coefficient of a developing country to rise (due to increasing inequality of income) while the number of people in absolute poverty decreases.This is because the Gini coefficient measures relative, not absolute, wealth.</p>

        <h2>GDP (PPP)</h2>
        <h3>What is GDP?</h3>
        <p>Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period.</p>
        <h3>Difference between Nominal and PPP?</h3>
        <p>GDP comparisons using PPP are arguably more useful than those using nominal GDP when assessing a nation's domestic market because PPP takes into account the relative cost of local goods, services and inflation rates of the country, rather than using international market exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in per capita income.</p>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>Critics of the growth imperative often argue that GDP measures were never intended to measure progress, and leave out key other externalities, such as resource extraction, environmental impact and unpaid domestic work.</p>

        <h2>HDI</h2>
        <h3>What is HDI?</h3>
        <p>HDI (Human Development Index) was created to emphasize that people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria for assessing the development of a country, not economic growth alone.</p>
        <h3>What does HDI actually mean</h3>
        <p>A country scores a higher HDI when the lifespan is higher, the education level is higher, and the gross national income GNI (PPP) per capita is higher.</p>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>The index does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking for some of the most advanced countries.</p>

        <h2>Unemployment</h2>
        <h3>What is unemployment?</h3>
        <p>Unemployment, according to the OECD, is people above a specified age (usually 15) not being in paid employment or self-employment but currently available for work during the reference period.</p>
        <h3>How do we interpret this value?</h3>
        <p>Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate, which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the labour force (the total number of people employed added to those unemployed).</p>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>Because of the difficulty in measuring the unemployment rate by, for example, using surveys or through registered unemployed citizens , statistical figures such as the employment-to-population ratio might be more suitable for evaluating the status of the workforce and the economy if they were based on people who are registered</p>
